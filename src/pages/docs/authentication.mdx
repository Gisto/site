## Privacy/authentication

Gisto authenticates to GitHub by using GitHub Access token

You may manually create an access token from the account settings at GitHub and login using the generated token.

Gisto only saves the Access token in your local storage and nothing else.

This token will be saved permanently until you log out, or it will expire.
