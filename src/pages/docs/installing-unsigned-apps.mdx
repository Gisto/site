## This App is Not Code-Signed

Since this is an open-source project and we currently do not have the resources to purchase code-signing certificates, the application **is not signed**. As a result:

- **On Windows**: You may see a warning like _"Windows protected your PC"_ or _"Unrecognized app."_
- **On macOS**: You may see a message saying _"This app is from an unidentified developer."_

These warnings are normal for unsigned applications and do not mean the app is harmful. However, always ensure you download the app from the **official release page of this repository** to avoid tampered files.

## How to Install the Unsigned App

### **Windows**:

1. When the warning appears, click **More info**.
2. Select **Run anyway** to proceed with the installation.

### **macOS**:

1. After downloading, if you see the warning, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General**.
2. Click **Open Anyway** next to the blocked app message.
3. Confirm by clicking **Open** when prompted.
