## Overview

The search functionality allows you to find snippets quickly by filtering based on description, title, tags, language, and other attributes. You can use free text search or specific search operators to refine your results.

## Search Options

### Free Text Search

Simply enter any keywords to search for snippets by description or file contents.

### Search by Tags

Use `tag:<your-search>` to find snippets with a specific tag.

Example: tag:react will return all snippets tagged with "react".

### Search by Language

Use `lang:<your-search>` to filter snippets based on programming language.

Example: `lang:javascript` will return all JavaScript snippets.

### Search by Stars

Use `is:starred` to find snippets you have starred.

Use `is:unstarred` to find snippets that are not starred.

### Search by Visibility

Use `is:private` to find private snippets.

Use `is:public` to find publicly shared snippets.

### Search for Un-Tagged Snippets

Use `is:untagged` to find snippets that have no tags assigned.

## Combining Search Filters

You can combine multiple search filters for more precise results. For example:

`lang:python tag:automation is:starred` – Finds all starred Python snippets tagged with "automation".

`tag:graphql is:public` – Finds all public snippets tagged with "graphql".

`lang:typescript is:untagged` – Finds all untagged TypeScript snippets.

## Quick Search by Clicking Tags or Languages

Instead of typing queries manually, you can click on a tag or language in the UI to filter snippets instantly.

Use these powerful search capabilities to quickly locate your desired snippets!
